Through the use of logical rules I wrote an AI capable of deducing the conclusion of certain problems and puzzles.
If we consider logical propositions such as P, Q, R and S we can assume the following rules to be true:

1. A logical proposition can either be true or false
2. Conjuction: P & Q. It means we have both P and Q evaluated as true
3. Disjunction: P or Q. It means we have at least one of them evaluated as true
4. Double Negative: ~~Q. It is the same as having a double false, i.e, true
5. The implication rule: P => Q.  It means that Q is always true, depite the value of P. A simplification of the implication rule can be (~P or Q)

Using the rules described above the AI was capable of deducing various solutions to logical problems.
